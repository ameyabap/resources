## Configuration

The plugin automatically creates a configuration directory at `~/.config/xbar-timezone/` to store your primary timezone preference. This setting persists across xbar restarts.

## DST Rules

The plugin implements accurate DST rules for:

- **North America**: Second Sunday in March to First Sunday in November
- **Europe**: Last Sunday in March to Last Sunday in October  
- **Australia**: First Sunday in October to First Sunday in April (next year)
- **New Zealand**: Last Sunday in September to First Sunday in April (next year)

DST calculations are accurate for years 2020 and beyond.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- xbar application

## Technical Details

- **Dependencies**: Python 3 standard library only
- **Configuration Storage**: `~/.config/xbar-timezone/primary_timezone.txt`

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Not Appearing
- Ensure the file is executable: `chmod +x timezone-display.30s.py`
- Check that Python 3 is installed: `python3 --version`

### Configuration Issues

- Delete the config directory to reset to defaults
- Primary timezone defaults to UTC if config is corrupted
